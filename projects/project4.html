                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>An intelligent AI-powered chatbot designed to revolutionize customer support through natural language understanding and machine learning. This assistant can handle complex queries, provide accurate responses, and learn from interactions to improve over time.</p>
                
                <h2>Key Features</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Natural language understanding with BERT models</li>
                    <li>Multi-language support (English, Spanish, French, German)</li>
                    <li>Context-aware conversation handling</li>
                    <li>Intent classification and entity extraction</li>
                    <li>Sentiment analysis for customer satisfaction</li>
                    <li>Integration with knowledge base and FAQs</li>
                    <li>Escalation to human agents when needed</li>
                    <li>Analytics dashboard for performance tracking</li>
                    <li>Continuous learning from user interactions</li>
                    <li>API integration with existing support systems</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>Technical Implementation</h2>
                <p>The core AI model is built using TensorFlow and fine-tuned BERT transformers for superior natural language understanding. SpaCy handles entity recognition and text preprocessing. The Flask backend provides RESTful APIs for seamless integration with various platforms.</p>
                
                <h2>Challenges & Solutions</h2>
                <p>Training the model to understand domain-specific terminology and context required extensive data collection and preprocessing. We implemented transfer learning and active learning techniques to continuously improve accuracy while minimizing manual labeling effort.</p>
                
                <h2>Results</h2>
                <p>The AI assistant successfully resolves 75% of customer queries without human intervention, reducing support costs by 40%. Average response time decreased from 5 minutes to 3 seconds, and customer satisfaction scores improved by 30%.</p>
