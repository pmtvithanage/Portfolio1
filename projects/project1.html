                <h2>Technical Implementation</h2>
                <p>The frontend is built with React and Redux for state management, providing a dynamic and responsive user interface. The backend utilizes Node.js with Express for RESTful API endpoints, connected to MongoDB for database operations. Payment processing is handled securely through Stripe's API integration.</p>
                
                <h2>Challenges & Solutions</h2>
                <p>One of the main challenges was implementing real-time inventory updates across multiple users. This was solved by implementing WebSocket connections for live updates and optimistic UI updates to ensure a smooth user experience.</p>
                
                <h2>Results</h2>
                <p>The platform successfully handles thousands of concurrent users, with a 99.9% uptime and fast page load times. Customer satisfaction increased by 40% after deployment, with an average order completion rate of 85%.</p>
